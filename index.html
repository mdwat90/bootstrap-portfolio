                    Hello! My name is Michael David Watson, but I traditionally go by David. I am originally from Athens, AL, but moved to Colorado with my wife from Atlanta, GA in January, 2018. I am a part-time preacher at the church I attend. When not working, you can find me either hanging out with my wife at home or outdoors mountain biking, playing soccer, or being physically active in some way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My passion for coding developed over the course of the last year as I began my journey toward web development through UX Design. I took an online course at General Assembly, and since then, I have built my own portfolio and developed a passion for writing code. I took another online course through Udemy to learn the basics of HTML and CSS, as well as a little JavaScript. Now, I am fully committed to the development of my skills by completing the University of Denver's Coding Bootcamp and creating a new path for myself in the web development world.
